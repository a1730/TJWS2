TJWS release 1.118

TJWS is currently in a maintenance mode with a 6 months cadence of
bug fixing releases. There are some new features mostly from the backlog 
of not implemented features due a low demand. Check the change log
to see if something worth of your interest is there. Java 11 or higher
 is preferred for running the server. However the server wasn't tested
 on Java 18 yet.
